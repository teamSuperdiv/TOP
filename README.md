Repo for everything related to The Odin Project

This is my very own repo for "the odin project".
I actually came to TOP to repeat the JavaScript fundamentals, do the projects and for the backend.

I know CSS and HTML pretty well and have done some frontend projects already.
But hey, you can never know enough and it's always good to practice and repeat.
